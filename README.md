# Survey_Website
The application is designed to facilitate survey creation, participation, and management.

# Technology Stack:
- Node.js and Express.js:
Leveraging Node.js as the runtime environment and Express.js as the web application framework, the backend is built for handling HTTP requests, managing routes, and overall server-side logic.

- MongoDB and Mongoose:
MongoDB, a NoSQL document-oriented database, is employed for data storage. Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool, facilitates seamless communication between the Node.js application and the MongoDB database.

- Passport.js for Authentication:
Passport.js is utilized to implement both local authentication (username and password) and JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication strategies, ensuring secure user access.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT):
JWT is used to enhance security by implementing token-based authentication. It enables secure communication between different parts of the application.
- Express Session and Cookie-Parser:
Middleware packages such as Express Session and Cookie-Parser are incorporated to manage user sessions and parse cookies, contributing to overall application security.
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
CORS is implemented to facilitate secure cross-origin data sharing between the frontend and backend components, ensuring effective communication across domains.
- HTTP-Errors for Standardized Errors:
HTTP-Errors is employed to create standardized HTTP errors, simplifying error handling and communication of error states within the application.
- Passport-JWT and Passport-Local Strategies:
Passport-JWT is used for JSON Web Token authentication, while Passport-Local handles local authentication strategies, providing flexibility and security in user authentication.
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript):
EJS is chosen as the view engine for rendering dynamic content in HTML templates, allowing seamless integration of JavaScript with the frontend.
- Bootstrap and CSS Styling:
Bootstrap is utilized for frontend styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Custom CSS is applied to enhance the overall design aesthetics.
- Node Modules and Packages:
Various Node modules and packages, including 'http', 'path', 'express-session', and others, are employed to extend functionality and features, contributing to a well-structured and efficient codebase.
